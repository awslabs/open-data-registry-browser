Title: NOAA Open Data Dissemination Program
Description: |
    Amazon Web Services has entered into a research agreement with the 
    US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to explore 
    sustainable models to increase the output of open NOAA data. Publicly 
    available NOAA data drives multi-billion dollar industries and critical 
    research efforts. Under this agreement, AWS and its collaborators will 
    look at ways to push more NOAA data to the cloud and build an ecosystem 
    of innovation around it.
