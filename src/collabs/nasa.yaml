  Amazon Web Services and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
  have entered into a Space Act Agreement to explore best practices around discovery,
  access, and use of high-value NASA science datasets. Making analytics-optimized data
  stores available to the science community will minimize the need for data wrangling
  and preprocessing within the community, leading to a faster time to insight and quicker
