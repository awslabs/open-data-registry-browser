Title: Space Telescope Science Institute
Description: |
    The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy 
    (AURA) with the goal of helping humanity explore the universe with advanced space telescopes and ever-growing data 
    archives. We have performed science operation for the Hubble Space Telescope since its launch in 1990 and we lead the 
    science and mission operations for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), planned to launch in 2021. We will perform 
    parts of the science operations for the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and we are partners on several 
    other NASA missions. We host the Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) which curates and disseminates 
    data from over 20 astronomical missions; and we bring science to the world through internationally recognized news, 
    education, and public outreach programs. 
    
    With the datasets hosted through the AWS Public Dataset Program we aim to allow the astronomical community to carry out 
    research to lead to new scientific discoveries.
