Title: Space Telescope Science Institute
Description: |
    The [Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)](https://www.stsci.edu/) is operated by the [Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA)](https://www.aura-astronomy.org/) 
    to help humanity explore the universe with advanced space telescopes and ever-growing data archives. 
    We have performed science operations for the [Hubble Space Telescope (HST)](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/hst) since its launch in 1990, and 
    we lead the science and mission operations for the [James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/jwst), launched in 2021. 
    We are the Science Operations Center for the [Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman)](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/roman), and 
    we are partners on several other NASA missions. We host the [Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)](https://archive.stsci.edu/), 
    which curates and disseminates data from over 20 astronomical missions. 
    We bring science to the world through internationally recognized news, education, and public outreach programs. 
    With the datasets hosted through the AWS Open Data Program, we aim to allow the astronomical community to conduct research that will lead to new scientific discoveries.
